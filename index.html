    <p>Twas a time of fear, a time where only the strong could prevail, while the weak perished and cowered in the shadows... The world was out of balance, justice was nowhere to be found, and no one coiuld be trusted. On another dreaded day in the kingdom of Aridia, a boy named <span id='dude'></span> felt like a change was gravely needed. As he walked the streets of the kingdom, he looked around him and noticed all the poverty that reigned on the peasants and farmers, he saw the families dwell on the streets with no other places to go, and he felt for them. As he grew up, he decided he wanted to be the change he wanted to see in this pathetic world, he trained hard, practiced for years, no blood, sweat or tears could stop him from achieving his ultimate goal and reaching his target. The day had came, the knight trials, what he had trained for his entire life. He felt as he was born for this, and so he went on to challenge the most powerful knight of all: Sir Mace the proud. As he threw his gauntlet onto the beneath of his future opponent, gasps could be heard coming from every corner. Sir Mace gave him a chance to back down from the challenge, for he did want to hurt him. <span id='dudeTwo'></span> said:</p>
    <button onclick='backDown()' id='option-one'>You are correct, I am not worthy of your time</button>
    <button onclick='nope()' id='option-two'>Do not worry about me sir, be worried about yourself</button>
    <p id='outcome'></p>
    <p id='rest'><span id='dudeThree'></span>'s plan was coming all together, he hadn't become a knight to simply fight for his people, but he wanted to end the ruling of the evil king, <span id='man'></span>. As a knight, <span id='dudeFour'></span> could now infiltrate the castle without worrying about being spotted, and all he needed to do was get to the throne room. <span id='dudeFive'></span> had earned a good reputation for defeating the strongest knight in the kingdom, he had earned everyone's respect and was highly honored among the villagers. As <span id='dudeSix'></span> was walking around the stretched hallways of the king's castle, he stumbled upon a room labaled KING <span id='manTwo'></span>'s ROOM, NO ENTRY. And so, by force of curiosity, <span id='dudeSeven'></span> opened the door walked straight in. There he was, the evil lord <span id='manThree'></span>. <span id='dudeEight'></span> pulled out his father's sword from his scabbard,and as he looked in the king's eyes, he thought of all the people he made suffer, had murdered at his command, all the families whom had done nothing wrong to deserve their fate. But then again, he remembered the royal family, the prince that had done nothing wrong to deservethe loss of his father at such a young age.
